## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

A service manual CRUD API with .NET, PostgreSQL and Docker.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To run the app, you need to have Docker installed and running.

You need to also add a .env (environment variables file named `.env`) into the root with following values:

```bash
# Database configuration:
DB_HOST=db  # This must be the same as in `compose.yaml`
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=factory
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_OWN_PASSWORD  # Just put some password, it will be automatically created

DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=0
```

Now you can start the app by running `docker compose up --build` in the root folder.

You can also use the `start.sh` script for a quick setup. It asks for the `.env` values
and creates/updates the file if it's not already created with the necessary values.
Finally it runs `docker compose up --build`.

The app will be available at <http://localhost:8080>.

Now you can try `curl http://localhost:8080/api/FactoryDevices/` to get:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Device 0",
    "year": 2004,
    "type": "Type 19"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Device 1",
    "year": 1987,
    "type": "Type 2"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Device 2",
    "year": 1982,
    "type": "Type 11"
  },
  ...
]
```

See `Requests.http` -file for more example requests
(You can use a Visual Studio Code extension for making the requests directly from the file.
